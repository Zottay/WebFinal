        <h2>About the Site</h2>
        <p>This website is dedicated to uncovering the hidden gems of Toronto. Created by Taylor Ni, a proud Torontonian and aspiring web developer/computer programmer for the purpose of completing the final WEB222NCC assignment. The idea behind this site was born out of a passion for exploring the city and finding spots that are off the beaten path.</p>
        
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there, I’m Taylor. Having called Toronto home for the past 22 years, I've had the privilege of watching this city evolve while still cherishing the spots that make it special. My love for travel has always pushed me to explore, but it's in Toronto's nooks and crannies where I find the most joy.

            I'm currently diving into the world of web development and computer programming, but outside of that, my curiosity drives me to seek out and share the understated wonders of my city. The Toronto Islands? I've spent more days there than I can count, from picnics to the unexpected thrill of the Pokémon Go craze. The Distillery District has its own charm, especially during Christmas when it takes on a cozy, festive vibe. And High Park, with its touch of nature, offers a breather from Toronto's cityscape.
            
            I think what makes these places special isn't just their beauty, but the memories they house. Sharing these spots with others and hoping they're appreciated (and preserved) is something close to my heart.</p>
